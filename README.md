### AstroQuiz - Project 3 of Google Udacity Android Basic Nanodegree 2018
This android app is limited to 30 questions for astronomy quizzes. [Here is the full project Review 1 from the udacity reviewer as on Jun 20, 2018.](https://review.udacity.com/#!/reviews/1293431/shared)
There is the project requirement to 'Questions are in a variety of formats such as free text response, checkboxes, and radio buttons', so this project is replaced by [Quiz](https://github.com/exospecies/quiz-p3guabnd18).
